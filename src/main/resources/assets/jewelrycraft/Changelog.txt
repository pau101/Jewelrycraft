Both 1.6.4 and 1.7.10
- Fixed bug with Natura causing the game to crash
Only 1.7.10
- Updated the mod to Minecraft 1.7.10
- Added more config options regarding Jeweler house generation
- Reduced the number of possible jewelers to spawn in a village to 1
- Added Molten Metal and Molten Metal Buckets
- Buckets of the molten metal can be obtained either by filling a smelter with the metal of your choice and then right clicking the smelter with an empty bucket, 
or by destroying the filled smelter, causing the metal to pour out and then use a bucket to pick it up.
- Smelters now spawn molten metal, if they have any, when broken
- Added the possibility to smelt ores
- Smelted ores give double the amount of ingots
- Jewelers houses now have a chance to also generate ores
- Jewelers can sell ores now
- Fixed a bug where the first time you would pour metal in a molder it would generate 2 items instead of one

TODO
- Make a way so that the ingot affects the jewels somehow
- Add a ring of Resistance
- Think of a way to balance the rings
- (MAYBE) Shadow Ring -> Shadow ingot ring, nether star, obsidian - makes you appear as hostile so mobs actually leave you alone
- Elemental jewellery -> punch a creature with it in your hand to do different things, lightning, fling into the air, set on fire, 
  encase in ice/fences/iron bars, turn into a sheep (like that spell from Warcraft 2, if anyone remembers that), blindness, extreme 
  knockback, charm (turns on your enemies), tame - tames any tamable mob
!- Add Necklaces, bracelets and earrings; Necklaces could have an AOE effect;
- Shadow armor and tools
- Add an item that can store rings (maybe a keychain?)
- Monks Ring -> ups your unarmed damage / block breaking speed / ability to break harder blocks with bare hands, made with a block of iron and a jewel.
- Ring of Strength -> self explanatory
- (MAYBE) Add a Shadow Merchant (a villager that trades only shadow related stuff and appears randomly at night)
- Add a blast protection jewelry
- Add a jewelery of the Arrow Catcher - each tier of protection gives you a certain % chance of catching arrows instead of being hit by them.
- (MAYBE) Render the rings on the character
- In the case of passive benefits, might it be possible to make it so, with fire resistance for example, it refreshes the buff as long as you're not in fire, 
  but as soon as you are it gains a limited duration (better jewels for longer durations) that, when it expires there goes the buff and you can burn to death. 
  Then you'd need to avoid being on fire for a cooldown period of a few seconds before it could refresh back to the passive state (this part reduced by better jewels)? 
  Invisibility could turn off for a period when you punch a mob, that kind of thing. 
- Glowstone Block (Modifier): Places a torch-like blob of light in exchange for 1/2 a heart, higher-tier jewels increase the light emitted.
- Ghast Tear (Modifier): Allows for a limited-duration flight buff, say starting at 3 seconds all the way to 60 when combined with a nether star. When the timer expires 
  you have to land again to reset the usage.
- Any Color Dye (Modifier): Right-click a sheep to dye it the chosen color. Posted Image
- Beacon (Modifier): Portable beacon, with the tier based on the jewel added. Shift + Right-click to open the beacon GUI, which would work just like the vanilla one.
- Water Bucket (Modifier): Right-click the air to start a storm.
- Lava Bucket (Modifier): Passively adds fire aspect to your weapons and tools.
- Sand (Modifier): Shift + right-click to advance the day 1 hour. Only usable once per day by default, better jewels increase this.
- Glass (Jewel): Right-click while holding the ring to zoom in!
- Lapis Piece (Modifier): Passively adds a slowing effect to your weapons. Better jewels improve this.
- Lapis Block (Jewel): A jewel that looks pretty but doesn't do much else.
- Bone (Jewel): Right-click to trade 1/2 a hunger for a bonemeal effect. Otherwise a white jewel with no benefit.
- Carrot (Modifier): Right-click to trade 1/2 a heart for 1/2 a hunger. Better jewels increase these values. 4 hearts for a steaks-worth of food? XD
- Diamond Block (Jewel): When on a gold ring it turns it into "Ostentatious Wedding Ring". Otherwise the same (or a little better than) diamond.
- Golden Apple (Jewel): Ring becomes named "Discord". Right-clicking gives an entirely random buff, a debuff, launches you high into the air, teleports you to a 
  random location, sets you on fire, spawns a pig or makes lightning strike. Pretty much anything can happen, and the more biased to negative results the better. :P
- Enchanted Golden Apple (Jewel): As above, but more biased towards positive effects. Hail Discordia!
- Name Tag (Jewel): Right-clicking a mob gives it a random name (bonus points if it's from a user-editable list!)
- Add randomly generated "named" loot to dungeon chests!  Ring of Displacement (lets you tele randomly like an enderman), Necklace of Second Chances 
  (heals you for 50 when you drop to 3 or fewer hearts with a cooldown of ~1 minute), Trinket of the Gale (arrow/fireball immunity!), Goggles of the Merfolk 
  (water breathing!). Endless possibilities! :D
- Also! Trinkets and Belts!

Trinkets would probably require a new mold, and should bring out the more passive side of items (like, say, instead of opening an enderchest, it automatically 
sucks items into your ender chest, or instead of teleporting you it prevents endermen from teleporting away from you [which could be done pretty easily with a 
fake screen overlay that's treated like the pumpkin one]).

Belts... I'd personally see belts as a ring crafted with a piece of Leather as the "jewel" and could provide conditional buffs proportionate to some factor, like 
say increasing strength buff the lower your HP is. The idea being that the belt should assist you in a useful way, but only when its needed. I'd probably limit it 
to HP and Hunger as determining factors. Things like resistance, regeneration and strength could be applied at low HP, while things like jump boost, haste and speed 
could be applied at high hunger meter values. I wouldn't tie anything to having high/max HP or no hunger since those would be things that players normally try to 
avoid or always have.

And as for goggles... A new mold for the base goggle template, and have it only accept "jewel"-typed items (as "lenses"). If you can't think of where to put a neat 
effect it should probably end up on goggles. Off the top of my head I can think of a few neat uses: Ore Radar (2x diamonds), Clear Vision (2x glass), Mob Spawnable 
Area Highlighting (2x ender pearl), Compass and Clock overlays (doy), Coordinate HUD (map and glass), Speedometer (glass and enderpearl), Altimiter (glass and emerald),
Thermometer (diamond and glass)... Required Pickaxe Level HUD (no idea). XD

Oooh! And last but not least: Cursed items! I'd probably start with an upgraded jewelry table requiring a regular one, a brewing stand, a piece of glass and a stick. 
You could initially use this upgraded stand to add additional effects, or merge two items into one. Should operate kind of like a furnace, but only accepts blaze powder 
and rods as fuel (about 1 rod or 2 powder = 1 process, the idea being using the blaze stuff like welding materials). But the other use would be cursing jewelry! Why?  
Because nothing says "I hate you so much." like a non-dequipable piece of jewelry that gives you blindness and slowness! Slimeballs could add a cursed sticky effect 
that prevents you dropping it without dying. Fermented spider eye, like with brewing potions, could corrupt the effects on the item. Flint and steel could randomly set 
you on fire. Eye of Ender could randomly tell the world your coordinates.
